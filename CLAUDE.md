# Funplay Unity MCP Project Guidance

This section is managed by Funplay MCP for Unity for Claude Code. Everything between the begin and end markers is regenerated on each sync; edit outside this block.

## Installed skills

- `unity-mcp-workflow` v1.0.3 - Efficient workflow for using Unity MCP to edit, import, compile, inspect, and test Unity projects.
- `unity-ui-composition` v1.0.3 - Build and revise responsive Unity uGUI mobile interfaces, including portrait and landscape layouts, safe areas, prefabs, auto layout, scrolling, text, input, animation, and performance validation.

## Preferred workflow

- Use Funplay MCP tools for Unity editor state and automation.
- Use `execute_code` for non-trivial Unity orchestration. For new snippets, include `using Funplay.Editor.Tools.Scripting;`, implement `IFunplayCommand`, and use `ctx.RegisterObjectCreation` / `RegisterObjectModification` / `DestroyObject` so changes participate in Undo and `ctx.Log` for traceable output.
- Confirm the Unity project root, active scene, and real object/prefab/asset path before edits. Treat user-provided object names as hints, not paths.
- Inspect Unity objects through MCP before changing user-named scene or prefab targets. Carry the returned `instanceId` into follow-up calls (`find_method=by_id`) instead of re-resolving by name.
- Tool returns are structured JSON (`{success, message, data}` / `{success: false, code, error, data}`). Branch on `code`, not free-form text.
- Set component fields with `set_component_property(ies)` — it picks up `[SerializeField] private` fields and accepts Object references as `{"fileID": <instanceId>}` or `{"assetPath": "Assets/..."}`.
- For field-only prefab asset edits, use `set_prefab_property(ies)` with a verified `Assets/**/*.prefab` path. If it reports duplicate paths or components, retry only with an index from that response; use Prefab Mode for structural edits.
- Read editor state through `get_selection`, `get_prefab_stage`, `get_tags`, `get_layers`, `get_build_settings`; try `execute_menu_item` before writing ad-hoc `execute_code`.
- Never edit `.unity`, `.prefab`, or `.asset` files with shell text tools or patches; use Unity MCP / Editor APIs for scenes, prefabs, and ScriptableObject assets.
- Save only the scene or prefab assets intentionally modified, then read back exact values.
- With default `core` exposure, use the focused workflow tools. With default `full` exposure, prefer specific MCP tools for simple editor operations.
- `execute_code` refreshes assets and waits for compilation before running. For other tools that depend on freshly compiled code, still call `request_recompile` after external script edits.
- In `execute_code`, null-guard every lookup and return explicit missing path/object/component messages; do not run self-healing fallback loops.
- For Unity object references, do not use `??=` for lazy rebinding; use explicit `if (field == null) field = Resolve();`.
- After code or resource edits, exit Play Mode if needed, call `request_recompile`, `wait_for_compilation`, then read compilation or console errors.
- `request_recompile` is rejected while Unity is in Play Mode. Call `exit_play_mode` first, then retry.
- After `enter_play_mode`, the HTTP server briefly drops while Unity reloads the domain. Poll `tools/list` or `get_reload_recovery_status` until it responds again before issuing the next tool call.
- If domain reload interrupts a request, treat the result as unknown until `get_reload_recovery_status`, compilation checks, and MCP readback confirm it.
- If a Claude Code session reports another `funplay-*` MCP server entry as unreachable, check whether its name matches this project's own before treating Funplay as broken. Funplay registers one independent entry per Unity project, but Claude Code's connection check surfaces every registered entry on the machine regardless of which project the session is in — a different project's entry being disconnected is expected when that project's Editor isn't currently open, and it should not be deleted, since it may still be in active use by that project.
